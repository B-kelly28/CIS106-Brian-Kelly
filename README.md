# Brian Kelly

## Assignment 1

I am Brian Kelly and I am taking this course because it is required for my certificate in software development. I am also taking this course to help improve my understanding with programming. My programming language will be python because I feel that it is the most user-friendly of all the other programming languages we could choose. I would like to use python for a future job, but I still do not have an exact idea about my future.
