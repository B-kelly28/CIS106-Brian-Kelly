# Brian Kelly

## Assignment 1

I am Brian Kelly and I am taking this course because it is required for my certificate in software development. I am also taking this course to help improve my understanding with programming. My programming language will be python because I feel that it is the most user-friendly of all the other programming languages we could choose. I would like to use python for a future job, but I still do not have an exact idea about my future.

## Assignment 2

What I learned about coding so far is how I can use inputs and outputs for the user to use and declaring variables for the program to use when registering user inputs. What I can do with the source code is visualize how the user will read the program and how I can find errors within the program if the inputs/outputs do not look the way they should. I will be using PyCharm as my IDE and I plan to use it for future classes to help enhance my coding abilities.
